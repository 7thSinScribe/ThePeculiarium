## What is this?

Welcome to The Black Book, the Peculiarium Paradoxicum or simply The Book. Here you'll find musings on development, the in-progress rules to The Outsider RPG; you will also discover short stories & poems which take place within the mysterious bounds of the Noumenon. 

## Who are you? 

My name is not important; I am a vagrant, a vagabond; a wanderer of Terras unknown.
