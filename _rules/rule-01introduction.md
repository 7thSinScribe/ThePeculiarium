Errth is a world you think you've seen, 
Where plants are purple; instead of green 

Errth is a world; an oblate sphere
to tell the truth, belief reigns here


Errth is a world of lazy gods
with a second Sunday - to even the odds



Errth is a world of Magick & Might
Where Alkaldur brings days of night

<h2>Welcome to Errth</h2>
<pre>
A land of ancient mystery, boundless potential, and untamed beauty. In a universe shaped by the whims of the Noumenon, a self-reinforcing feedback loop which constructs & reinforces reality. Errth is a plane(t) of contrasts, where civilizations cling to the edges of sprawling wilderness, and colossal megafauna roam the land, their forms a testament to the boundless wonders of the Noumenon.

This is a world where science and magic blur together, blending the rational and the arcane into a singular, ever-shifting force that defies comprehension.

It is here, in this savage & surreal universe that mysterious, voluntary exiles known as Outsiders wander the land to discover secrets, aid the hopeless & uphold the fickle balance that holds the Noumenon together.
