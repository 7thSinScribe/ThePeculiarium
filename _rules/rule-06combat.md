<h1>Stages of Play</h1>
<p>Following Outsider's almost dogmatic adherence to the rule of three, combat is resolved in 17 in-depth steps; the first is the most important step where you realize I was joking. Combat in Outsider occurs in three stages; Intent, Action(s), Resolution. Combat may take place in the abstracted theatre of the mind; or with minis on a hex-grid </p>
<h2>Intent</h2>
<p>The Intent stage serves as the foundation for each round of combat, where each Actor outlines their desired course of action. This step is crucial for establishing clear objectives and ensuring that all players have a shared understanding of the unfolding events. By expressing a primary goal, ranging from a general idea like "I want to escape!" to a more detailed plan such as "I want to create a protective circle of salt around the Spirit," players can better coordinate their efforts, strategize effectively, and create a more immersive and engaging combat experience.</p>
<h2>Action(s)</h2>
<p>During this stage, you announce the specific Action(s) your Actor(s) will undertake in the current round. You may perform up to three actions per turn; however, each additional action will affect the overall Speed of your actions. The more actions you take, the slower they will be executed, with a reduction in Speed equal to the number of Actions Taken after one. This creates a trade-off between the number of actions and their execution speed, promoting strategic decision-making and balancing the flow of combat.</p>
<p>The Speed & names of the basic actions are</p>

    III. Swift: <em>Quick actions like basic attacks, moving up to half your speed, or using a simple skill.</em>
    II. Steady: <em>Paced actions like casting a spell, making a manoeuvre, moving up to your speed, or disengaging.</em>
    I. Deliberate: <em>Slow actions that require concentration, like channeling a powerful spell, grappling, setting up a trap or making a powerful attack.</em>

<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>Following the Action Declaration stage, take note of the Speed for each action undertaken. Actions will then take place from highest to lowest Speed. If actions share the same Speed, they occur and are resolved simultaneously, potentially leading to situations where both opponents may suffer consequences, such as in a duel where both combatants could be defeated. After the resolution stage, return to the intent stage until a clear victor emerges.</p>
