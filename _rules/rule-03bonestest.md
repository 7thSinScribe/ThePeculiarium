<h1>Them Bones</h1>
Bones are a set of dice which define an actor's baseline capabilities unlike other rolls you'll make, bones explode on the maximum result, meaning you roll it again and add it to your total. Many actors, such as Humans, Beasts & the Outsiders themselves share the same set of three Bones in varying sizes; they are

<b>ACUITY</b>

This Bone represents an actor's mental and sensory prowess. It encompasses intelligence, coordination, and intuition. An actor with high Acuity is learned, observant, and able to process information quickly.

<b>CELERITY</b>

This bone represents an actor's physical agility and ability to think on their feet. It encompasses speed, reflex &amp; roguishness. An actor with high Celerity is quick on their feet &amp; reacts to unexpected situations with ease. 

<b>TENACITY</b>

This Bone represents an actor's physical and mental resilience. It encompasses strength, endurance, and willpower. An actor with high Tenacity is tough and able to push through difficult challenges without giving up.

<b>ROLLING & READING</b>
When the outcome of your action(s) are not apparent; you will most often roll & read one of your bones, comparing it to a Target; a number set by the Overseer to determine the outcome of your action(s) the Target is most commonly a number between 5 & 10, with exceptionally difficult challenges above 1

<h2>Outcomes in detail</h2>

<ul class="outcomes-list">
  <li><b>FIASCO</b>: Disaster strikes and your plans crumble before your eyes. Not only did you fail, but your actions have caused an even worse situation to unfold. <em>Example: Trying to disarm a trap, you accidentally trigger it, causing the ceiling to collapse on you and your allies.</em></li>
  
  <li><b>FAILURE</b>: Despite your efforts, you didn't quite achieve your goal, and things didn't go your way. <em>Example: In an attempt to negotiate with a hostile group, your words fall on deaf ears, leaving you with no choice but to prepare for conflict.</em></li>
  
  <li><b>MISHAP</b>: A close call or a minor obstacle, but there's still hope. You can choose to accept stress equal to the discrepancy and turn this into a success, or accept the failure and try again. <em>Example: While picking a lock, your tool slips, but you can either push through the stress and succeed or regroup and try again at an increased Target.</em></li>
  
  <li><b>SUCCESS</b>: Your hard work and determination paid off, and you've achieved your goal. <em>Example: You successfully convince the merchant at the Bazaar to buy your Titanoboa skin at an overpriced rate.</em></li>
  
  <li><b>GREAT SUCCESS</b>: An outstanding accomplishment, you've not only achieved your goal, but you've done so with exceptional skill or luck. <em>Example: Whilst searching for rare herbs, you not only find them, but a surprising supply.</em></li>
  
  <li><b>PYRRHIC VICTORY</b>: Success has its price, and this time, it's a steep one. Your actions have led to victory, but the consequences are more severe than you could have imagined. <em>Example: You defeat a powerful enemy with a crippling blow, but the force you have put into it has left you in a debilitated state.</em></li>
