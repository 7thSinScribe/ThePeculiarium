The following is a translated excerpt from what remains of the burned tome; one of many incomplete dialogues I have translated

Philosopher 1: I see you are troubled. What ails you?

Philosopher 2: Ah, my dear friend, I have been contemplating the mysteries of the universe, and I have come to a most confounding realization.

Philosopher 1: Pray, tell me, what is this realization that has vexed you so?

Philosopher 2: It is this: that the universe is a vast and complex place, full of wonder and mystery, and yet it is also fundamentally absurd and meaningless.

Philosopher 1: Ah, yes, I see what you mean. But what does this have to do with The Dead Man becoming a god?

Philosopher 2: Ah, well, you see, it all started one day when The Dead Man was walking down the street, minding his own business, when he was suddenly struck in the head by a flying fish.

Philosopher 1: A flying fish, you say?

Philosopher 2: Yes, a flying fish. It came out of nowhere, and it knocked him senseless. When he woke up, he realized that he had been granted immense power and wisdom by the cosmic forces that govern the universe.

Philosopher 1: And why, pray tell, would the cosmic forces grant such power and wisdom to a man who had been struck in the head by a flying fish?

Philosopher 2: Ah, well, that is the mystery, my friend. Some say that it was a test of his character, a way to see if he was worthy of such power. Others say that it was a cosmic joke, a way to show that even the most absurd things can have profound meaning.

Philosopher 1: I see. And what does The Dead Man himself say about all of this?

Philosopher 2: Ah, well, that is the most confounding part of all. The Dead Man himself is utterly silent on the matter. He simply shrugs his shoulders and says, "Hey, shit happens."

Philosopher 1: Truly, a most profound and mysterious tale. I shall have to contemplate it further.

Philosopher 2: Indeed, my friend. The universe is full of wonders and absurdities, and sometimes the two are one and the same.
