Through the Betweens we wander, seeking the unknown,
Our powers fueled by faith, in places few have roamed.

The path of the Outsider is one of endless change,
Weaving through the mysteries, both sublime & strange.

For we are the wardens of Errth, explorers of its depths,
mutant vagrants whose bait is every step.
