<pre>
There once was a man named Plott
 whose armour time had forgot.
Made of metal, silver, gold
 A marvel to behold

It shimmered, sparkled in the light,
 And filled his enemies with fright.

His armour, his armour, oh so fine,
 but beware, it's cursed design.
No swords nor arrows can pierce its shell,
 But the wearer of it suffers hell.

With each battle won, a new curse is born,
 the wearer's fate, forever torn.
For fortune favors not the man,
 who dons this armour, so cursed, bland.

It brings great strength & courage bold,
 but too misfortune, danger untold.

Wherever Plott went, trouble followed,
 his armour left the land hollowed.
The very air would tremble, shake,
 the Errth beneath his feet would quake.

No army could withstand his might,
 no foe could put up a fair fight.
But in the end, it was Plott alone,
 who reaped the seeds his armour had sown.
