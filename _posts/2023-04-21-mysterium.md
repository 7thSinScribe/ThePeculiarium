## i.

The moon was high in the sky, casting a pale amber glow over the forest as I wandered through it. I had been following a path that I thought would lead me to a nearby village, but it had suddenly vanished, leaving me lost and alone in the thickets. My mind was fogged with smokeherb, and my eyes were heavy from lack of sleep. I could hear the distant howl of a wolf, and it sent a shiver down my spine. I had heard tales of the beasts that roamed the forests, and I knew they were not to be trifled with.

Just as I was about to give up, a soft whisper stirred in my ear. I spun around, my senses on high alert, only to be confronted by a creature that defied description. The púca stood before me, a grotesque amalgamation of different animal parts. Its body was covered in sleek, shimmering black fur that seemed to ripple and shift with every movement. Its eyes were its most disturbing feature, despite their ochre shimmer - they were almost human, with all the intelligence and emotion that came with it. But they were set within a face that was distinctly equine, complete with flared nostrils and powerful jaws.

The púca's ears were long and pointed, like those of a rabbit, twitching and flicking with every sound. It seemed to regard me with an almost predatory curiosity, as though I were nothing more than an interesting specimen to be studied.

I stood there, frozen in fear and awe, unable to look away from the creature's unsettling eyes. It regarded me for a moment longer before speaking, its voice smooth and melodic despite its bizarre appearance.

"Lost, are you?" the púca asked, its features twisting into an amused expression, revealing it's decayed buck teeth

I was taken aback. I had heard tales of the púcas, but I never thought I'd actually encounter one. I was transfixed, unable to do anything other than nod.
